## Mutability and immutability
- **Immutability** describes objects with values that are **not changeable** in memory.  
    Basic Python data types - `str`, `int`, `float`, `complex` are **immutable**  
    e.g. 
```python
x = 3.141
y = x
```

- **Mutability** describes values that are **changeable** in memory, often when values share the same location.
    python types `list` and `dict` are mutable
