```python
import numpy as np
```

### Create an array
```python
np.array(object, dtype=None)
```
it will return an array object whose type is `ndarray`
`object` can be an array like object like `list`, or can be a scalar. If it's a scalar, it will return a 0-dimensional array. The shape will be `()`, which will be detailed later.
