So I know you're studying a STEM degree project. Where?  

And what are you studying?  

Do you see or use laser in your life or your experiment?  

OK. Today I'm gonna talk about high intensity laser, not one you met in your life. I'll talk not only how to make them, but also what's stopping them being made.  
We want do something that requires a huge photon density application, so that’s why we come up with chirped pulse amplification. Have you heard about that?

That means that we can stretch the pulse, safely amplify it, then compress it at the end, and then we’re ready to do whatever we want at the end.

So what do you think he main difference is between the continuous wave laser and chirped pulse amplification?

Yes, if you want to use the continuous wave laser to get a high power, you need a lot of energy but if you use chip power simplification, you can get a higher power because the time is much more short.
Maybe you’re curious about what’s the higher power can we go now. When we are developing terawatt laser, we use a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse. Now it’s the same terawatt but a joule with a pickles on pulse.
I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter.
So then in forward, one of the goals is can we reach 10 to the 29 watts per square centimeter?
To get this, we may need another Nobel Prize winning idea. But if we get this
