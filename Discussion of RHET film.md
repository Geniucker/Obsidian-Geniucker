It's a documentary about a story between a middle-aged man called Mark, who was unemployed, and a flock of parrots. Mark wanted to be a musician but he lost his job. He lived in a small rent-free apartment on Telegraph Hill. Later, he encountered a flock of parrots. Though he was shy even clumsy in daily life, he was as lively as a child while faced with these non-speaking parrots. He named each parrot include couple Sophie and Picasso. He's so familiar with parrots that passersby refused to believe that parrots were wild.
Seeing their sincere emotions, I start to think about people's attitude towards animals. Nowadays, with other exciting things increasing, people's passion on animals decrease obviously. Though a lot of people still adopt animals, many of them do not pay enough attention on them. Even some news that animals are abandoned come out occasionally. I think after this movie, wo should all reflect on what we and people around us have done and learn from him.

在电影中，我被马克和他的鹦鹉之间的特殊关系所触动。马克在业余时间喂养鹦鹉，使它们对马克产生了不同程度的依恋，马克也对这些有趣的鹦鹉产生了好感。对于这种珍贵的感情，我想我们应该珍惜它。

所以，我们应该尽力保护我们的动物朋友，以弥补过去对它们的伤害，恢复与它们的友谊，携手共创美好家园，促进人与动物、自然的和谐稳定发展。给予动物一个可以自由生长、生活和生存的环境，不打扰它们，不让它们按照人的意志、思维和行为去生活，是人与动物之间最好的关系，也是人们对动物的尊重和对它们最好的关爱和保护。

Yes, nature should always be honored. Especially animals can good friends of humans. Or actually we can say if there's really necessity to distinguish humans and other animals? Mark overcome the boundary and become close friends with parrots. From that he got deep cured his mind changed. That's the power that humans themselves don't necessarily have. If we abandon the view of so-called "humans" and "animals", we will both benefit from that. We will live in an harmonious atmosphere so they can live a life they are meant to live and we can get spiritual cured. That's a situation we desire.
